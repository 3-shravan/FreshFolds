Real-Time Status Update Functionalities Documentation

This project involves implementing real-time status update functionalities for an order management system. Various techniques were explored for real-time updates, such as WebSockets and polling. WebSockets provide a persistent connection between the client and server, allowing instant communication and data updates. Polling, on the other hand, regularly checks for updates at fixed intervals. WebSockets were chosen for better efficiency and faster updates.

Foundational screens for order status updates were developed to display the current status of orders in real time. Notifications are triggered when status changes occur, ensuring users are immediately informed of any updates.

Order scheduling and management functionalities were integrated with real-time updates to synchronize the customer's order flow with the backend processes. Additional features, such as location tracking, were implemented to provide precise updates on the location of orders during transit.

Unit testing was conducted to verify the real-time updates, ensuring that they were delivered accurately and promptly. Identified issues were fixed to enhance data accuracy. The system was also integrated with Order History & Tracking, allowing users to view historical status information and track their past orders efficiently. This robust solution ensures seamless order management with accurate real-time updates.
