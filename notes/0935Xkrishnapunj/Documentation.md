The project involves the development of an order scheduling and management system, focusing on foundational and advanced functionalities. Initially, foundational screens for customer order scheduling are developed, followed by the implementation of basic order scheduling features. These basic features will allow customers to create and manage their orders.

The development continues with advanced functionalities, such as order editing and cancellation, allowing more flexibility. Integration with pickup and delivery requests is a crucial step, ensuring that the system can handle various logistical needs. This integration helps streamline the process of managing orders from request to fulfillment.

Further, advanced features like recurring orders and priority settings will be implemented to accommodate customers with ongoing needs or urgent requirements. Unit testing is conducted to identify and address any potential issues, optimizing the scheduling process. The system is integrated with a pickup and delivery request system (developed by Student 5) to enhance processing efficiency.

The final phase includes thorough system testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the order management system. Any remaining bugs or issues are fixed, and comprehensive documentation is created to describe the development process and the features of the completed system. This ensures maintainability and scalability for future improvements.
